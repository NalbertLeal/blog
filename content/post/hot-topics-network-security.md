## Introduction
This is the second post to my personal blog, created because my professor Silvio Sampaio required to the students from the network security class write about 3 hot topics, my choices was "quantum computer impact over the encryption", "machine learning to computer security" and the last topic are "security of cloud and internet of things". This going be a very fast post, between two and five paragraphs to talk about each topic.


#### quantum computer impact over the encryption

The encryption is the act of receive a data, for example a message and return a sequency of characters that look like a randon text. The functions used to generate the "random text" are very used because of the need of security. Imagine if your username and password of facebook, twitter, google or github fall on the hand of everyone at the earth, you should have problems. To avoid this we use encryption like AES256 and RSA. But in same years probably these encryption methods will be obsolet because of the quantum computers.  
What is a quantum computer ? well, the classic computer (our actual computers) use the binary model (a sequence of 1s and 0s) and process sequencialy these sequence. But same years ago was discovered that we can create the "qubit", that's the representation of a bit 1 and 0 at the same time, so we can process at the same time two values. So, imagine you have the sequence: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 and 111. Now you want to find which of these numbers are equal to 101, sequencialy we need to try 000, then 001, then 010, then 011, then 100, and finaly 101. But the quantum computer with one qubit at the fist bit (qubit, bit, bit) would try at the same time 100 and 001 and then 001 and 101, so in two iterations the quantum discover what was in 6 interations on the classic computer.
With these power to discover numbers for it's very fast to discover with a number is a primal number or not. Thousands of times faster than a usual computer. All the base of the encryption systems are the primal numbers, so the actual model of encryption will die. But the future aren't dark, with the quantum computers came the quantum encryption, a model where the fisic material have influence over the result of the encrypted data.

#### machine learning to computer security

Could imagine your computer take a action by it own? well, it's possible with machine learning. This's a area of the information tecnology that are responsable for researchs that have as focus create computers that can learn based in actions, results and etc. This computers receive a set of inputs and based on that learn samething.
Now imagine this kind of ability in a computer responsable to garantee that a network that you acess are safe and that you will not be in danger while surf on the internet. That would be a huge security barrier to hackers. With machine learning the computer would analyse patterns of users, spam, malwares and even the frequency of words from the websites. With this the computer would improve the behavior and protect each time better the users.
This would make the network protected with this tecnology the most adapted to new risk and issues. Because of the adaptability of this system each time a new data came to be explored, the system would improve theirself .

#### security of cloud and internet of things

Today one of the areas with fastest growth is the internet of things. This area is responsable to little hardwares that execute simple tasks, at your office close the window of your bedroom in your home. This area have a big problem, security. Imagine this thousands of thousands of hardwares exposed, with out firewall to stop ilegal access, if a hacker kidnap thousands of this little hardwares a DDOS attack should be executed and would be very hard to stop. So the future are our lifes full of internet of things, but without a investment in firewall to run in these small hardwares we are in danger.
Another area that grow faast are the cloud computing. A lot of systems like google drive, google docs, heroku and firebase are cloud computing. This mean that we are accessing and using the service using the internet. So the server are the cloud. Enterprises like amazon and google offer this service. It's very convenient because of the security, price and the garantee that our service developed and posted to the amazon EC2 will always be online. But the encryption, attacks and infrastructure can make the latency of the system up, this is a problem.
