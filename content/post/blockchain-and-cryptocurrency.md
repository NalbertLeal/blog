## Introduction
These days a lot of new technologies have been created since the posts of Satoshi Nakamoto about the blockchain and cryptocurrency. But who is Satoshi and what is a blockchain? well, nobody knows who is him because this is a pseudonym, but his (or her) creation have a great potential to change the world, starting with the economy.

The incredible invention is the blockchain. I can resume this technology as a "confidence protocol", but it's much more than that. The focus is decentralized data to be safer and guarantee that everything inside the block of information is valid. Basically, there are different nodes (computers) with the same shared public list of registers and data. With the shared list same nodes validate every information that requests to be part of the block of information (the block) and after the validation, every node knows about the new data, so insert unchecked input or to modify something into the list is necessary to modify in all nodes.
